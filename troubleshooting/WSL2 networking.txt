Is literally anything working? In WSL:

    ping 1.1.1.1

If it's working the output should look something like this:

    % ping 1.1.1.1
    PING 1.1.1.1 (1.1.1.1) 56(84) bytes of data.
    64 bytes from 1.1.1.1: icmp_seq=1 ttl=53 time=10.7 ms
    64 bytes from 1.1.1.1: icmp_seq=2 ttl=53 time=10.9 ms
    64 bytes from 1.1.1.1: icmp_seq=3 ttl=53 time=10.7 ms
    ^C
    --- 1.1.1.1 ping statistics ---

    rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 10.731/10.795/10.915/0.084 ms

If pinging an IP doesn't work, could be bad adapter settings. Disable and
re-enable the WSL Windows optional feature to reset network settings and give
it another try. This will not delete distro data.

 1. If WSL has been used this boot, run `wsl --shutdown` in cmd or powershell
 2. Control Panel > "Programs" > "Turn Windows features on or off" > Uncheck
    "Windows Subsystem for Linux"
 3. Reboot when prompted
 4. Navigate to the same place and re-enable the feature
 5. Reboot again when prompted
 6. Do another ping test in a WSL window

If pinging an IP works, is DNS bad? In WSL:

    ping example.com

Should give similar output to above. If not, try telling WSL to use a different
nameserver.

 1. Drop this configuration in `/etc/wsl.conf` to prevent WSL from generating
    its own `resolv.conf` file, allowing us to set the nameservers manually:

        [network]
        generateResolvConf = false

 2. Drop a `nameserver` line in `/etc/resolv.conf` to set the DNS server (you
    may have to `rm /etc/wsl.conf` first):

        nameserver 1.1.1.1
        nameserver 1.0.0.1
