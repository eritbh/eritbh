Enter the recovery environment and use the "Command Prompt" troubleshooting
option. Assuming the Windows volume has drive letter E (not guaranteed to be C
like normal) and recovery volume has drive letter X.

Verify the disk is okay:

   chkdsk E:

Verify Windows system files are okay:

    sfc /scannow /offbootdir=E:\ /offwindir=E:\Windows

Recreate boot files:

    bcdboot E:\Windows

Check for Windows installations:

    bootrec /ScanOs

If you're out of options, check bootrec help and try an option that makes
sense:

    bootrec /?

You can't run explorer in the recovery environment, but you can run notepad and
use the "Open" menu item like an explorer window.
